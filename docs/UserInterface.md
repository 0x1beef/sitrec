# Sitec User Interface

Sitrec is a web application that will run in any popular desktop browser like Chrome, Safari, Edge, or Firefox. To run it you just enter or click on the URL of the installation. In this documentation I'll assume you are using the standard Metabunk installation

## The Menu System

Sitrec's menus are similar to Mac/Windows menus in that there's a menu bar, and you can click on a menu to open or close it.
