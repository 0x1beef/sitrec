cd ~/Dropbox/metabunk/sitrec

install all the mode packages with
npm install

build with:
npm run build

This just runs the script in package.json, but in the node environment. Webpack is part of node.
so needs to be in that environment (i.e. NOT brew install webpack).
Also some packages are from node.

That builds everything into the "dist" folder, from which you can run it
EXCEPT for:
- the videos, including the three stored as individual frames)
- sitRecServer

See webpack.common.js for details of what is copied over

npm run deploy

will build an optimized version into the deploy folder, which can then be copied into the web root.
